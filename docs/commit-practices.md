# Commit practices
All commits are made in development (feature) branches, not directly into the main branch ([branching practices](https://github.com/Ohtu-Tyoturvallisuus/TTS-frontend/blob/main/docs/branching-practices.md)).

Commit messages should be written by following these guidelines:
1. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* instead of *how*
8. Write commit messages in English

Examples and more about commit messages and these guidelines can be found [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).
