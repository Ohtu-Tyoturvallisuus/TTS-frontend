# Branching practices
For a new feature, developers shall create a new branch and develop it in its branch until the feature is ready ([Definition of Done](add link to DoD here)) to be merged into the main branch.

When the feature is ready to be merged the developer shall make a pull request (PR) and at least one other developer in the team shall review the PR before merging.
